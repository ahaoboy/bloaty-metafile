bloaty-metafile is a cli tool to convert csv files generated by [bloaty](https://github.com/google/bloaty) to esbuild's [metafile](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#metafile) format, so that you can use [online tools](https://esbuild.github.io/analyze/) to analyze the size of the program

```bash
cargo binstall bloaty-metafile

# or install from github
cargo install --git https://github.com/ahaoboy/bloaty-metafile

# https://github.com/google/bloaty/blob/main/doc/using.md
bloaty ./bloaty -d sections,symbols -n 0  --csv | bloaty-metafile > meta.json
bloaty-metafile meta.csv > meta.json

bloaty ./target/release/bloaty-metafile -d sections,symbols -n 0  --csv | bloaty-metafile --name=bloaty-metafile --lock=Cargo.lock  > meta.json
```

## profile

In order for bloaty to parse symbol information properly, it is recommended to keep debug information and turn off lto and strip

```toml
[profile.bloaty]
debug = true
lto = false
strip = false
inherits = 'release'
```

```bash
cargo build --profile bloaty
bloaty ./target/bloaty/bloaty-metafile -d sections,symbols -n 0  --csv > meta.csv
bloaty-metafile meta.csv --deep=0 > meta.json
```

## csv format

Please make sure bloaty generates a csv file in the following format. If the program is too large and the generated json exceeds 100mb, use the -n parameter to reduce the amount of data.

```
sections,symbols,vmsize,filesize
.text,ossl_aes_gcm_encrypt_avx512,337642,337642
.text,ossl_aes_gcm_decrypt_avx512,337638,337638
```

## Generate image from json

You can use [metafile-image](https://github.com/ahaoboy/metafile-image) implemented by nodejs to generate json files into image format, without manually uploading and screenshots

## Usage

### lock file

Because bloaty's output does not include crate dependency information, the sizes of crates are all displayed separately.

![llrt-no-lock](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/669c033f-72e8-49e9-b030-dffc370b6580)

If a lock file can be provided, by default, the Cargo.lock file in the current directory is used. the dependency size can be correctly displayed by analyzing the crate dependencies.

### deep

For large applications, the dependency tree will be very deep, which will cause the generated JSON to be very large and contain too much useless information. You can use the --deep option to limit the maximum depth of the dependency.

The default value of deep is 0(no limit)

deep: 4, json: 6.7M
![llrt-deep-4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2780c0ff-3a04-4aa3-946f-5c024347f1dd)

deep: 8, json: 12M
![llrt-deep-8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89a786ff-45e6-47b7-a931-edd59d1dff30)

deep: 0, json: 80M
![llrt-deep-0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2cbf935-340e-4dbd-8ca3-191340c9ae35)


### no-sections

Filter out SECTIONS that failed to count crates, and only display the recognized crate size usage.

The default value of no-sections is false


## Conversion rules

The symbol `.text,easy_install::install::artifact` will be converted to `easy_install/.text/install/artifact`.

Additionally, if symbol ends with `.map`, to prevent the esbuild analyzer from treating it as a JavaScript sourcemap file, the suffix will be converted to `.map_`.

If symbol is empty, it will be added to the `UNKNOWN` section.

## windows

bloaty: PE doesn't support this data source

bloaty-metafile just converts the csv output by bloaty to json. You can generate csv files on other platforms with bloaty, and then convert them on windows.
